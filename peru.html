          <p>After my parents spent considerable time in Guatemala, Uruguay, and
            Mexico, they decided they wanted to go back. Then spent year serving
            in South America and felt like they could do more. After a corporate
            reorganization nixed my Dad’s transfer to South America when I was
            young, they were left to figure something out on my own. It finally
            came together for my senior year of high school. They found an
            organization called <a href=“https://www.eaglecondor.org>Eagle
              Condor</a> that agreed to accommodate an entire family during
              their humanitarian program. This meant we took an entire facility
              meant for at least six students and made it our home.

          <p>My parents quickly got callings in the deteriorating ward, we found
            that one of the missionaries in the ward was related to a family in
            our stake, I was asked to explain auto mechanics to the young men
            and to home teach with the young men’s president, and we all quickly
            adjusted to the new lifestyle. Soon, we had the bus schedule and
            paths memorized, some of us were on the local swim team, and we
            already hated the cafeteria food. We had favorite restaurants,
            favorite street vendors, and desks and shelving in our rooms. For a
            few hours every afternoon, we would feed lunch to the children, then
            help them with homework, teach classes, and generally entertain
            them. This was sometimes their only meal in the day, and once they
            went home, they’d be helping in the fields. </p>

          <p>During our five months, we made it to Lima, Cajamarca, Llacanora,
            Cumbemayo, Puyllucana, Banos del Inca, Chiclayo, Trujillo, and
            Cuzco. We taught and baptized a school teacher who would travel more
            than eight hours to make it to church every Sunday, would eat lunch
            with us, then travel back. She was finally transferred to Llacanora,
            where it was a much shorter trip to Church. I competed in an
            inter-city swim meet for the local team and won three gold medals
            and one silver (by .01 seconds). At the same time, my older brother
            was serving his mission in Lima. We met some of his converts and
            companions, and even met with his mission president. We ended up
            going to the Temple on the same day, but missed each other by a
            couple hours. </p>
