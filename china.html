          <p>Just a week after returning from Colombia, a close friend called
            and asked if I wanted to move to China with him. Even though I
            basically hadn’t even unpacked, I told him I was down. His sister
            had gone to China years before with a non-profit group called
            <a href=“https://ilp.org”>ILP</a> and recommended the experience. We
            applied to the program and were accepted to the same city to teach
            English at a boarding school called QingYing Foreign Language School
            in Changzhou. Changzhou lies about halfway between Shanghai and
            Nanjing, meaning it’s about halfway up the coast and a couple hours
            inland. We met between classes at the University to open the email
            where it said we would go, spent a minute looking at things in the
            city, then went to class. We were very excited.

          <p>My parents both speak Spanish, and I was given a lot of exposure
          growing up. However, I never really cared much, and ended up getting
          a D- in Spanish in 8th grade. Since such a low grade didn’t advance
          me to the next level, I chose to take Chinese in high school instead
          . My teacher grew up in China and was a school teacher there. Her
          teaching style was difficult for me, but I loved the class. I took
          Chinese for three years, missing the fourth year because we had
          moved out of the country for the first semester. I loved Chinese,
          and I still dream about speaking it fluently. My friend took a
          Chinese calligraphy class the summer before we went, and we were
          both excited beyond anything to finally get there.</p>

          <p>I had almost 80 students between ages 5-10 that I would see in
            groups of about 10 for 25 minutes each. These students didn’t hardly
            know any English, mostly because they were young and hadn’t had much
            study. There were other teachers with older and more fluent students
            , but my friend and I both scored with the high energy and low
            discipline first and second graders. However, we didn’t really go to
            teach. While we spent our weekdays with the students, our weekends
            were our’s. We’d often leave Friday right after our last class, then
            return as late as Monday morning just before our first class. During
            national holidays we went further out, but often we just stayed
            within a few hours of Changzhou. During my five months, I started in
            Shenzhen then went to Huangshan, Guilin, Yangshuo, Wudangshan, Xian,
            Beijing, Shanghai, and Changzhou, finally settling in at the school.
            Then, with Changzhou as my home base, I went to Suzhou (a number of
            times), Shanghai (a few times), Yangshuo (again), Guilin (again),
            Zhangjiajie, Nanjing (twice), Huangshan (again), and Beijing
            (again). </p>
