          <p>You may not always choose when, where, or how. I didn’t choose to
            go to Colombia, but I chose to go somewhere. Before graduating high
            school, I applied to serve a mission for my church. The day I
            graduated I opened the announcement for where I would serve. Knowing
            a little Spanish (and having failed Spanish), I mispronounced
            “Medellín” as soon as I saw it. I’ll always blame that on the
            missing accent over the i. The Church gave me almost five months to
            prepare, so I went ahead and started college.

          <p>I studied thee years of Chinese in high school and failed a year of
            Spanish in middle school, but maybe the Church figured my time in
            Peru was good preparation. Either way, we believe the assignments
            are inspired, so possibly there was no human logic involved. Maybe
            it was all my childhood exposure to Spanish, or the time spend not
            understanding anyone in Peru, or maybe divine intervention, but once
            the plane landed in Bogotá, I felt like I could speak Spanish. I
            acted as translator between the bus driver and the other four
            English-speaking missionaries on our way to the Missionary Training
            Center (CCM in Spanish) where we would be taught Spanish. This was
            six weeks pretty cooped up with an intensive language study schedule
            from our first class at 8am to our last class at 8pm.</p>

          <p>During my 24 months in Colombia, I made it to Bogota, Envigado,
            Medellin, Itagui, Belen, Sabaneta, Monteria, Cerete, Lorica,
            Armenia, Calarca, San Pelayo, Pereira, Dos Quebradas, Santa Rosa,
            Sevilla, and surely more. I remember transferring my area of
            operations from Envigado to Cerete, nearly eleven hours in bus, then
            to Armenia for another 15 hours, then Monteria, another 15 hours,
            then to Dos Quebradas, about another 12 hours. Through the whole
            period, a focus was on learning the culture and language. I spend
            all day in the houses of locals or on the streets between houses of
            locals. Unlike my time in China, traveling was kept pretty minimal.
            We didn’t make trips except either on Monday’s or to travel to
            someone’s house far away. My first visit to San Pelayo was after
            walking more than two hours from Cerete. All the other trips were on
            Jeep once we learned better.</p>
